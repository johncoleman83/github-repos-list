                                        <h1><i>Her perspective</i></h1><p>I first met John when I was in graduate school at Northwestern University. We began our relationship by writing to each other before we decided to meet up in person. John’s messages to me were so thoughtful and kind that, honestly, there was a part of me that was reluctant to meet him in person because I thought that he was too good to be true! Over time, I have come to realize that the truth is my imagination could have never crafted someone as amazing as John; he has surpassed all my hopes and dreams for a partner.
</p>
<h1><i>First Date</i></h1>
<p>
For our first date, John asked me to have dinner with him at Dave’s Italian Kitchen on February 23rd, 2014. Anyone who knows me knows that I am typically always running late for events. My first date with John was no exception. But, he waited patiently for me, reading a book in a corner table at Dave’s. When I arrived, the hostess joked that John was “crying” in the corner because he thought I stood him up, but she also joked that she had a feeling our date would be worth the wait. I knew John is humble and has a good sense of humor because he was able to laugh at himself along with the hostess’ quips. I felt guilty for being late, and John with his calm, gentle demeanor told me “Tranquila”, which means “calm down” in Spanish. That interaction set the tone for the rest of the date; John’s demeanor and gentle, patient nature put me completely at ease. I had never met someone before who I immediately felt so comfortable and familiar with, but yet felt as if I had so much to learn about this complex and fascinating person.

Shortly after our first date, I quickly began spending most of my spare time with John, which was not much, being in graduate school. But, as we continued to get to know each other, John was patient, flexible and very creative about planning fun and meaningful dates for us. One of our most memorable dates to me was when John surprised me at my apartment with some delicious treats from Great Harvest Bread, while I was in the midst of studying for comprehensives. He brought me “brain food” including lemon and monkey breads, which he remembered are two of my favorite treats. We definitely love food and have enjoyed experiencing restaurants together.

One of our favorite spots, when I lived in Evanston, was Hartigan’s Ice Cream Shoppe; a particular memory stands out to me there when I had an inkling that John was “the one”. A few months into dating , we stopped to share some ice cream on a Sunday night. I started having melancholic feelings on Sunday nights because I knew my time with John was coming to an end until next weekend when I could see him, again. I was really embarrassed, and feel reluctant to admit this now, but John looked over at me, from across the booth and I started crying into our ice cream sundae. We went into the privacy of his car and he asked me what was wrong. I told him that I get incredibly sad on Sunday evenings because I know I won’t see him again for another week. I expected him to be scared off by this powerful display of emotions, but instead he held my hands, embraced me and said, “It’s okay, Amanda. I know how you feel. I get really sad, too, when we have to say goodbye”.  I love this memory of us because it captures what I love most about our relationship in a few brief moments. John has always welcomed my most raw and passionate sides of myself into our relationship. I knew he was special from that moment on because he showed me that he could tolerate my best--and most vulnerable--sides with sensitivity and grace.

<h1><i>Engagement</i></h1>
<p>
Of course one of my favorite ‘John stories’ is our proposal story. I drove to John’s home in Hyde Park on a Friday night; he greeted me with a few beautiful roses and carnations. The next day, he rushed around to pick me up from my fellowship and was driving like he was still living in Ecuador…this made me feel like something was up, but I rationalized his erratic driving as just everyday stress. So, on we travelled to the Girl and the Goat, and had a delicious meal; I truly enjoyed every moment of the dinner, from the first sip of my cocktail to the last bite of my dessert, and everything in-between.  Then, John planned to honor our feminist and humorous sides by taking me to an all female comedy show in Wrigleyville. The next morning, on Sunday April 19th, 2015, he treated me to a beautifully prepared breakfast in bed; it consisted of an egg sandwich and one of his famous smoothies. I savored it and felt very pampered. John asked if I would be interested in attending church with him at Alice Millar Chapel. Normally I might prefer to sleep in a little while longer, but that morning my heart told me to go. We travelled to Evanston together, and as we drove, I played my favorite love songs for John on my phone. I had been feeling so connected to him and loved by him that weekend, I felt inspired to play some music for his that expressed better than I could how I feel for him. We arrived at Alice Millar and the service was nice, but I am pretty sure John and I giggled like children in the back pews most of the service. Afterwards, we walked along Lake Michigan and I explained to him the significance of certain areas to me from while I was in grad school, including past peace circles and picnics. This part of campus radiates with personal meaning to me. It was the perfect spot to sit inside a nearby Weeping Willow tree that had an opening in the middle of the trunk. We sat in the tree while we dangled our feet over a small pond. John commented on the beauty of this spot on campus and told me that it seemed like the perfect place to give me a love letter he had written me. I started to read it and was deeply moved by it. I noticed that it said that it said at the bottom “2 out of 3” when I had reached the end. He explained that the last part was verbal and he proceeded to explain the meaning behind each aspect of the weekend he had planned, including the significance of Alice Millar and the importance of our shared values as the foundation for our relationship. He expressed his confidence in our connection and his desire to have me as his wife and one day start our own family together. I was overwhelmed with joy; I have never been so happy before in my whole life! I was so excited to tell my parents; I called them right away and they disclosed that they colluded with John to keep this a secret from me because he already asked them for my hand in marriage a couple weeks prior in Plainfield. My parents are absolutely thrilled to have John join our family. The morning of the proposal, my mom and dad visited the cemetery to “tell” my Grandma and Grandpa and other relatives passed that John and I would be engaged soon. My grandma adored John and gave him her blessing, too, before she passed away last October. In fact, she promised to be dancing all night on our wedding day, if and when we decided to “tie the knot”. She knew, in her grandmotherly wisdom, that he was, and always will be, the one for me. 
</p><p>
John has since supported me through multiple moves, family illnesses and loss, and career changes. He has been with me through my personal process of growth and healing and shared in my deepest belly laughs and joy. My Faith has deepened as a result of our relationship, as I am often amazed by how beautifully and poetically our life stories have aligned. I am so excited for this next chapter in our lives! My heart is full with gratitude for all the kind words of support and encouragement we have received from family and friends thus far. I cannot wait to marry my best friend and soulmate, John Coleman, on June 25th, 2016!

</p><h1><i>His perspective</i></h1><p>When speaking about first meeting Amanda, I like to focus on how much we had in common including our interests in social welfare, personal growth and achievement, studying at University of Chicago together, and so many other similarities like in our shared tastes and interests.  Writing with Amanda for the month before we met helped us learn about how much we have in common, but I like to most remember our first date.  On that evening in Evanston, IL, we ordered the same meal of a salmon pasta dish, and it seems like everytime we are together, we have more and more in common.  Our sense of style, taste, and preferences are very uniquely similar, which always improves my bond with Amanda because it makes it so easy to get along when we are in agreement so often.  Of course first seeing Amanda and realizing how beautiful she is, was a moment that highly influenced my love for Amanda; I hope to remember that forever.  Her beauty was so captivating that I wanted the moment of our first meeting to last a lifetime.  Every time we spend more time together, I see and recognize new aspects of Amanda’s beauty that so amaze me.
</p><p>
Some of the main aspects of Amanda that I most appreciate are in her ability to communicate effectively with me, her sense of beauty and artistic sense, her emphasis on personal growth and self-knowledge, and her care, compassion, and concern for others, relationships, the vulnerable, and life in general.  Our artistic bond has taken many forms including, drawing, an enduring mosaic, and other crafts.  Being creative with Amanda has sincerely helped with my bond with her, I think we could spend days, weeks, and hopefuly years creating art together; I look forward to many more art projects to come.
</p><p>
There are three beautiful moments that I most remember when thinking about falling in love with Amanda.  In these moments, I realized that not only was I comfortable considering to spend the rest of my life with her, but even more that these moments confirmed my decision to ask Amanda if she would join me in marriage.  The first was more of a time period of around Amanda’s Grandmother Barb’s 70th birthday.  In these moments, Amanda spent most of her time and energy in hospice being with and considering the needs of her Grandmother surviving through ovarian cancer.  Amanda’s dedication to this process was undeniable.  Being able to witness and experience Amanda’s unconditional love, dedication, care, humility, and generosity during most sensitive and life testing moments made me fall in love with Amanda.  I knew that she would be faithful to a family in the most difficult and most important moments of life, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of her life.
</p><p>
The second was in our anniversary trip to Madison Wisconsin.  Amanda had prepared a love letter for me that touched my heart so powerfully.  I knew that she had taken the time to learn about me, my interests, qualities, and while knowing so much about me and who I truly was, she loved and cared about me.  What a lifelong dream that I had always been hoping for that someone would know who I truly was and love me.
</p><p>
The third moment, was of course when we got engaged.  That weekend was full of romantic and beautiful moments that confirmed that I had made one of the best decisions of my life to ask Amanda to spend the rest of her life with me in marriage.</p>
